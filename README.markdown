# Getting the source code

If you'd like to test this on your own, get the source code for this presentation
[on github](http://github.com/riethmayer/cucumber_java_presentation).

# Getting started

First time I used this to install all dependencies:

    mvn clean integration-test -Dcucumber.installGems=true
    
After that I run `mvn integration-test` to run the cucumber scenarios.    

# Dependencies

* Maven2
