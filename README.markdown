# Getting started

First time I used this to install all dependencies:

    mvn clean integration-test -Dcucumber.installGems=true
    
After that I run `mvn integration-test` to run the cucumber scenarios.    

# Dependencies

* Maven2

# I left some broken tests on purpose

In order to have a good starting point doing the clean, rinse and repeat step, there are some steps which might be implemented by yourself.
